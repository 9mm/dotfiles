## Installation

* Install the fonts in .vim/font (some are required for vim-powerline fancy status bar)
* I prefer a fork of Macvim that has an OSX-style project drawer. You can find pre-compiled binaries [here](http://pineapple.io/resources/add-file-browser-to-macvim)
* I have purchased [PeepOpen](http://pineapple.io/resources/peepopen-command-t-like-file-navigation). The Vim plugin is contained within this repo, but the paid portion is not, so you will need to buy it or remove it (I highly recommend it. I like it far more than NERDTree, Command-T, FuzzyFinder, etc.). Random tip for PeepOpen: Use `âŒ˜+r` to reload the file tree (if you add new files you must refresh) 
* Install autojump with `brew install autojump`. It's basically a cd command that learns, and allows you to access most-used directories and files by using fuzzy matching. [See here](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump).
* Inside `.irbrc` is Wirble which colorizes irb. Use `gem install wirble` to install.
* Install [iTerm 2](https://raw.github.com/9mm/dotfiles/master/.vim/screenshot.png)
* Install oh-my-zsh with `curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh`
