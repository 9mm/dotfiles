## Installation

* Install the fonts in .vim/font (some are required for vim-powerline fancy status bar)
* I prefer a fork of Macvim that has an OSX-style project drawer. You can find pre-compiled binaries [here](http://pineapple.io/resources/add-file-browser-to-macvim)
    * **note** Lately I have abandoned this fork and use NerdTree with a vanilla `brew install macvim` because of problems with Ruby. Even with using homebrew (which uses your currently active Ruby and Python when compiling), it still has issues with linking to the newest version of Python. If you wish to do the same, `brew uninstall python && brew uninstall macvim && brew install python && brew install macvim`. You will *still* need to follow the directions for linking to a custom version of Python (see below).
* I have purchased [PeepOpen](http://pineapple.io/resources/peepopen-command-t-like-file-navigation). The Vim plugin is contained within this repo, but the paid portion is not, so you will need to buy it or remove it (I highly recommend it. I like it far more than NERDTree, Command-T, FuzzyFinder, etc.). Random tip for PeepOpen: Use `âŒ˜+r` to reload the file tree (if you add new files you must refresh) 
* Install autojump with `brew install autojump`. It's basically a cd command that learns, and allows you to access most-used directories and files by using fuzzy matching. [See here](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump)
* Inside `.irbrc` is Wirble which colorizes irb. Add it to your project's Gemfile and `bundle install`
* Install [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/)
* Run `git config --global color.ui true` in terminal. This will add a few lines to your `~/.gitconfig` to allow `git` to be colorized in iTerm 2
* Install oh-my-zsh with `curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh`
 
## Link MacVim to Homebrew Python

Many Vim plugins use Python and have extremely troublesome issues on versions of MacVim compiled with system Python. Even if you install MacVim with homebrew with the latest Python active, it still seems to compile with system Python. To fix, you want to link homebrew Macvim to homebrew Python manually:

* Install Homebrew Python with `brew install python`.
* Remove old version of MacVim with `brew uninstall macvim && brew install macvim`
* If you run `otool -L /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim` and see system Python in that list, you will likely have a problem. Note that if you don't symlink MacVim to `/Applications` your path will need to link to the Cellar directory accordingly. 
* Follow [this](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/issues/241#issuecomment-16466715) solution by running the following code. You will need to once again change the last path (for MacVim and Vim) according to whether you symlinked Macvim.

```
install_name_tool -change /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/MacVim
install_name_tool -change /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS/Vim
```

That's it. Rerunning `otool` should show you a new output. Now your MacVim is linked to homebrew Python. You can probably do the same for Ruby although I have not tried, Ruby seems to work fine as is.
