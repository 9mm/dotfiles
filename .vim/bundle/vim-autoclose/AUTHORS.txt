The primary author of vim-autoclose is Thiago dos Santos Alves
<talk@thiagoalves.com.br>, who may be found online at
<http://www.thiagoalves.com.br>.

Buffer idea to avoid undo break was gather from delimitMate
plug-in created by Israel Chauca F. <israelchauca@gmail.com>.

At this point there were so many fixes by two other guys that
I even consider them co-authors of AutoClose plugin as it is
now. Many thanks to:

Artem Baguinski <artm@v2.nl>
Daniel Hahler <git@thequod.de>

Also thanks to Peter Jaros <peter.a.jaros@gmail.com> for some
bug fixes as well.
