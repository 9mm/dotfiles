# to avoid indexing 500,000 files ~ use the following logic:
# - if no arguments are provided and the current directory is ~, set ~/Desktop to working directory
# - if no arguments are provided and the current directory is not ~, open neovim normally
# - if a directory is provided as an argument, set that working directory
# - if a file is provided as an argument, open that file directly
#
# vim uses the cwd of the process to determine the working directory of vim. This is what
# happens when you pass no flags. To override this, we need to use -c to set :cd ourself
